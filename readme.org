* Reference one-loop dictionary for linear SM extensions

This repository contains the matching data linked to in Fig. 1 in our paper
arXiv:2402.XXXXX.

The outer directory structure represents the rows of the figure, i.e. the
B-conserving SMEFT operators as they appear in the order they appear along the
y-axis. The inner structure represents the columns of the figure, i.e. linear SM
extensions as they appear along the x-axis of the heat map.

Although this reference is not intended to be used apart from the figure in our
paper, we have also included the operator name and flavour indices as a
Mathematica replacement rule in each text file, and the name of the mass in the
denominator of each matching expression can also be used to identify which
multiplet has been integrated out.
